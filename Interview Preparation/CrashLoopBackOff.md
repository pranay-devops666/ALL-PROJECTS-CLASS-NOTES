🚀 Kubernetes Debugging Guide: CrashLoopBackOff in Production
📌 Overview
CrashLoopBackOff is one of the most common and critical issues in Kubernetes.

Pod keeps restarting repeatedly and never becomes stable.

This guide explains:

What CrashLoopBackOff means
Step-by-step debugging approach
Real production root causes
Fix strategies
🧠 What is CrashLoopBackOff?
CrashLoopBackOff means:

Container starts → crashes → Kubernetes restarts it
This loop continues with increasing delay
🎯 Goal
Identify:

Why the container is crashing
Fix the root cause
Prevent repeated failures
🔍 Step 1: Check Pod Status
kubectl get pods
Look for:

STATUS: CrashLoopBackOff
Restart count increasing
🔍 Step 2: Describe the Pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Check:

Events section
Errors (OOMKilled, Back-off restarting)
🔍 Step 3: Check Container Logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
If restarting fast:

kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
👉 This shows logs from the last failed container

⚠️ Step 4: Check Exit Code
From describe pod:

Exit Code	Meaning
1	Application error
137	OOMKilled (Out of Memory)
126/127	Command not found
139	Segmentation fault
⚡ Step 5: Check Resource Limits (OOMKilled)
Problem:
Container exceeds memory limit → killed

Check:
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
Look for:

OOMKilled
Fix:
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    memory: "1Gi"
🔍 Step 6: Check Application Configuration
Common issues:
Wrong environment variables
Missing configs
Invalid startup command
Fix:
Verify env variables
Validate config files
Test container locally
🔍 Step 7: Check Liveness Probe
Problem:
Liveness probe fails → Kubernetes restarts container

Example issue:
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 8080
If endpoint fails → restart loop

Fix:
Correct endpoint
Increase initial delay
initialDelaySeconds: 30
🔍 Step 8: Check Readiness Probe
Problem:
Readiness probe failing → traffic not routed

(Not direct crash cause but impacts behavior)

🔍 Step 9: Check Image Issues
Problems:
Wrong image tag
Corrupt image
Missing dependencies
Fix:
Verify image exists
Pull locally and test
🔍 Step 10: Check Command / Entrypoint
Problem:
Wrong command causes immediate exit

Example:
command: ["wrong-command"]
Fix:
Validate entrypoint
Test container manually
🔍 Step 11: Dependency Issues
Problem:
App depends on:

Database
External API
If dependency is down → app crashes

Fix:
Add retry logic
Use initContainers
Wait for dependencies
🔍 Step 12: Check Volume Mounts
Problem:
Missing volume
Permission issues
Fix:
Verify mounts
Check file permissions
🔍 Step 13: Node Issues
Problem:
Node resource pressure
Disk/memory issues
Check:
kubectl describe node
📊 Common Root Causes
Issue	Impact
OOMKilled	Memory exceeded
Bad config	App crash
Liveness probe	Restart loop
Wrong command	Immediate exit
Dependency failure	Crash
Image issue	Startup failure
🎯 Final Debugging Checklist
 Checked pod logs (--previous)
 Verified exit code
 Checked resource limits
 Validated env/config
 Verified probes
 Checked image and command
 Verified dependencies
🚀 Best Practices
Always set resource requests/limits
Use proper liveness/readiness probes
Add retry logic in apps
Validate configs before deploy
Monitor pod restarts
📌 Conclusion
CrashLoopBackOff is not random.

It is usually caused by:

Resource limits
Misconfiguration
Probe failures
Dependency issues
Systematic debugging helps resolve it quickly 🚀
